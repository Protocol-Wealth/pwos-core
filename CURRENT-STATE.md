## What's published

**19 packages live on npm under the `@protocolwealthos/*` scope** (Apache 2.0; USPTO patent-pending #64/034,215; OIN member; published with provenance via the Changesets release workflow). All are `0.x` — the pre-1.0 series signals an intentionally-unstable API where breaking changes are permitted in minor versions until `1.0`.

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `audit-log` | 0.5.0 | Append-only log + SHA-256 hash chaining + 3 anomaly detectors + approver-separation |
| `pii-guard` | 0.4.0 | 4-layer PII scanner + streaming rehydrator + account-number masker |
| `compliance` | 0.3.0 | SEC 204-2 retention, Books & Records bundler, calendar, incidents, vendor-doc metadata |
| `crm` | 0.3.0 | Contacts / households / interactions / opportunities / tasks |
| `mcp-tools` | 0.3.0 | Tool registry + tier classification + filters + confirmation gate + tool-audit builder |
| `ai-guardrails` | 0.2.0 | Workspace (ZDR) assertion + model allowlist + prompt-cache + content-free audit row |
| `auth` | 0.2.0 | HS256 JWT session + role guard + Workspace-domain restriction + per-agent tokens |
| `cache-keys` | 0.2.0 | Namespace-enforced cache-key builder with PII-pattern rejection |
| `disclosure-card` | 0.2.0 | Machine-readable AI-system disclosure schema (Zod + dep-free JSON Schema) — flagship adoptable standard |
| `document-gen` | 0.2.0 | Document model + CSV + plain-text renderer + DocumentRenderer interface |
| `email-archive` | 0.2.0 | SEC 17a-4 archive primitives |
| `gcp-helpers` | 0.2.0 | Cloud Logging + Cloud SQL IAM picker + Secret Manager loader + frontend error shape |
| `holdings` | 0.2.0 | Account / Security / immutable HoldingEvent stream + materialized HoldingSnapshot |
| `ledger` | 0.2.0 | Append-only double-entry + sum-to-zero invariant + bailment-mode shadow ledger |
| `onchain-sdk` | 0.2.0 | Onchain data-shape primitives |
| `security-headers` | 0.2.0 | HSTS / strict CSP / X-Frame / X-Content-Type / Referrer-Policy / Permissions-Policy |
| `shared` | 0.2.0 | Cross-package types + two governance primitives (`hitl` fail-closed gate + `provenance` hash-chain) |
| `webhooks` | 0.2.0 | HMAC-SHA256 verify + dual-layer path-token + Basic Auth + idempotency |
| `workflow-engine` | 0.2.0 | Storage-agnostic durable-job runtime |

`apps/api/` (reference scaffold) and `apps/evals/` (eval harness v0) are workspace packages kept `private: true` — fork-to-use, not published.

## What shipped recently

- **CFP-substrate governance hardening (2026-05-27, via #43 + release #44 + docs #45):**
  - **Flagship governance primitives** added to `@protocolwealthos/shared`: `hitl` (fail-closed human-in-the-loop gate, two-class default policy), `disclosure` (the disclosure-card schema), `provenance` (SHA-256 hash-chained records with tamper-detection). `@protocolwealthos/disclosure-card` split into its own published package as the flagship adoptable-standard artifact (Zod + dep-free JSON Schema + `assertNoVerifyMarkers` pre-publish gate).
  - **`apps/evals/`** eval harness v0 — five categories (regulatory_hallucination, suitability, marketing_rule_leakage, pii_bypass, prompt_injection), 15 synthetic fixtures, provider-agnostic deterministic runner.
  - Governance-doc rewrites (CONTRIBUTING / SECURITY / CODE_OF_CONDUCT / README) — package list corrected to the full 19; autonomy wording reconciled ("the framework does not ship an unattended client-action mode"); `What's Open vs Private` section added.
  - `ai-guardrails` README clarified that the workspace assertion enforces the ZDR API-surface boundary (#45).

## Open / private boundary

**Open (this repo):** the 19 published packages — generic, storage-agnostic, framework-agnostic primitives (the *shape*) — plus the canonical-pattern docs and the `apps/api/` reference scaffold. **Private (in `pw-os-v2` / `pw-api` / `pw-portal-v2`):** the production orchestrator, real client data, firm-wired vendor clients, production thresholds / kill-rule cutoffs / decay constants, and credentials (the *settings*). Principle: **shape is open, settings are private.**

## Build / test status

Green at last verification. Hermetic tests (no network, no live keys, no real client/vendor data); `pnpm -r build && pnpm -r typecheck && pnpm -r test` all pass. CI gates SPDX headers + per-package tests; releases publish via Changesets with npm provenance.

## Open items

- **Dependabot (as of 2026-06-01):** #47 `zod` 3.25 → 4.4 (major — coordinate across every package that imports zod), #46 minor-and-patch group. Triage per the major-vs-minor rule before merge.
- **Cross-repo wiring** the private estate owes against the new governance primitives is tracked in [`HANDOFF.md`](./HANDOFF.md) (provenance → `ai_audit_log`; disclosure-card → Compliance Center + `/disclosures`; hitl → tool orchestrator gate).
